# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build, Lint & Test Commands
- Build: TBD (To be defined as project evolves)
- Lint: TBD
- Test: TBD
- Single test: TBD

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces) and line endings
- **Imports**: Group imports by external libraries, then internal modules
- **Types**: Use strong typing where applicable
- **Naming**: 
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes and components
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors explicitly, avoid silent failures
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs and non-obvious implementations
- **Commits**: Use conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, etc.)

This document will be updated as the project structure and requirements evolve.
